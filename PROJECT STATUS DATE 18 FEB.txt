Below is a concise summary of our current plan and roadmap for our trading bot project:

1. Core Stability & Reliability Improvements

Data Integrity Checks:
Clean incoming data (convert types, forward-fill missing values, replace zeros, etc.).
Validate that key columns (open, high, low, close, volume) contain valid numbers before processing.
Enhanced Logging & Error Handling:
Use a rotating file handler to log critical events, warnings, and errors.
Add custom exception handling and more granular logging for each step (data fetch, indicator calculations, signal generation, order placement, etc.).
2. Modularization & Code Organization

Decoupling Components:
Split the code into modules (e.g., data_fetching.py, indicators.py, signal_generation.py, order_execution.py, notifications.py).
Configuration Management:
Centralize constants and thresholds in a config file or use environment variables to avoid hardcoding.
3. Performance Optimization & Scalability

Profiling & Benchmarking:
Use profiling tools (cProfile, line_profiler) to identify bottlenecks.
Optimize the most time‐consuming parts (e.g., indicator calculations) possibly using Numba or vectorized operations.
Asynchronous & Parallel Processing:
Implement asynchronous data fetching (using asyncio/aiohttp) for I/O-bound tasks like API calls.
Consider parallel processing for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy indicator calculations or backtesting) with multiprocessing or Dask.
Data Caching & API Call Reduction:
Cache historical data locally to reduce redundant API calls.
Batch API requests where possible.
4. Machine Learning & Signal Generation

Model Optimization:
Improve the ML model (currently a dummy KNN example) by tuning hyperparameters and using cross‑validation.
Consider incremental/online learning if live retraining is needed.
5. Connectivity & Multi-API Support

Dual Connectivity:
Ensure the bot can switch smoothly between TWS and Binance based on configuration flags.
Add fallback logic and clear error messages if one connection fails.
API Credential Management:
Support multiple API keys/credentials from the .env file (with different variable names).
6. Testing, Monitoring, & Documentation

Unit Tests:
Develop unit tests for each module (data fetching, indicator calculations, signal generation, order execution) to ensure future changes don’t break core functionality.
Real-Time Monitoring:
Integrate notification systems (Telegram, SMS, Email) and consider adding dashboards for performance monitoring.
Documentation:
Provide detailed docstrings and maintain a change log for tracking improvements and modifications.
This roadmap outlines our immediate steps to enhance the core engine’s stability, optimize performance, modularize the code, and set the foundation for adding advanced trading strategies in the future.
